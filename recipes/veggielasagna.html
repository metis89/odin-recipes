  <p><h3>Fast and delicious veggie lasagna in 1 hour 30 minutes!</h3></p>
  <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian casserole.For our favorite healthy vegetable lasagna recipe, 
    I bulk up the marinara sauce with a combination of sweet bell pepper, sliced mushrooms, diced onion, 
    diced zucchini and minced garlic. The good news is that you can mix it up and modify the recipe to include any 
    of your family's favorites. Corn, diced eggplant, or spinach would all be great additions. 
    In the fall, I'll probably go with some butternut squash and kale!</p>
  <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
      <li>8 ounces sliced mushrooms</li>
      <li>1 zucchini, diced</li>
      <li>1 sweet bell pepper (any color), seeded and diced</li>
      <li>1 onion, diced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh garlic</li>
      <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley (or 2 teaspoons dried parsley flakes)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil (or 2 teaspoons dried basil)</li>
      <li>15 ounces ricotta cheese (or sub with 16 ounces small curd cottage cheese)</li>
      <li>2 ¼ cups grated mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
      <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
      <li>24 ounces (2 ½ cups) store-bought (or homemade) marinara sauce</li>
      <li>9 oven-ready, no-boil lasagna noodles (or as many noodles as needed to fit your dish)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <ol><strong>1.</strong> Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Spray a 9 x 13-inch baking dish with cooking spray and set aside</ol>
      <p></p>
      <ol><strong>2.</strong> In a large skillet or Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms, zucchini, bell pepper, onion, and garlic. Cook and stir the veggies just until tender (about 3-5 minutes).</ol>
      <p></p>
      <ol><strong>3.</strong> While the veggies cook, use a separate bowl to stir together egg, parsley, basil, ricotta cheese, 1 ¼ cups mozzarella, and ¼ cup Parmesan.</ol>
      <p></p>
      <ol><strong>4.</strong> When the vegetables are done cooking, stir the marinara sauce into the skillet.</ol>
      <p></p>
      <ol><strong>5.</strong> Spread ¼ of the marinara-vegetable sauce mixture in a thin layer in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Top with 3 no-boil lasagna noodles (or as many as you need to cover a single layer in the dish), ⅓ of the ricotta mixture, and another ¼ of the sauce mixture.</ol>
      <p></p>
      <ol><strong>6.</strong> Repeat layers two more times. Finish with remaining 1 cup of mozzarella and ¼ cup of Parmesan cheese on top. Cover with a piece of greased foil.</ol>
      <p></p>
      <ol><strong>7.</strong> Bake for 35 minutes. Remove foil, and bake for another 5-10 minutes (or until heated through and cheese on top is browned). Let stand for about 10 minutes before slicing and serving.</ol>
    </ul>
